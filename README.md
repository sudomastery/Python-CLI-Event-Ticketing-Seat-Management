# Python-CLI-Event-Ticketing-Seat-Management
A simple, reliable Event Ticketing &amp; Seat Management system using Python, SQLAlchemy (ORM), and PostgreSQL. The focus is on solid data modeling and correct booking logic (holds, checkouts, and concurrency control) rather than a web interface. The project will be CLI-driven, making it easy to run, test, and demonstrate.
